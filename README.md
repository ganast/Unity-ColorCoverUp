## About

Color Cover-Up is a casual puzzle game for mobile and desktop devices based on the well-known Mastermindâ„¢ board game. The goal is to find a secret consisting of four colors randomly selected at the beginning of each game. At each turn, the player chooses four colors from a palette of six, drops them onto the board and proceeds with the Go button. The game will then display a black mark for each choice matching both color and position and a white mark for each choice matching only color, without indicating which mark refers to which choice. The secret contains unique colors. Similarly, the player must make unique colors choices at each turn.

Color Cover-Up was developed as a demonstration and educational aid for the purposes of the Digital Games Development seminar organized by the Interactive Systems Design Laboratory, Department of Product and System Design Engineering, University of the Aegean and held in September 2018 in Syros, Greece.
